# Traffic-Sign-Detection-using-TF-and-OpenCV
Traffic sign detection is a high relevance computer vision problem and  is the basis for a lot of applications in industry such as Automotive etc.  Traffic signs can provide a wide range of variations between classes in  terms of color, shape, and the presence of pictograms or text. In this  project, I implemented a deep learning algorithm that will train on  German traffic sign images and then check accuracy of the  classification and output it. The deep learning model will be built using  TensorFlow and we will also understand various ways to pre-process  images using OpenCV.
